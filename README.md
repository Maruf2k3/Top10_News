## What is this project

-   This is a simple project which will get you top 10 most viewed news in each section 

## Usage

-   To use it use the Jsoup package that I have provided or use the maven way to install it it up to you
    and then just fire up the application and this will prompt you with selection and provide you with title name and link to that news

## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders, where:

-   'src'     : the folder to maintain sources
-   'lib'     : the folder to maintain dependencies
-   'packages': the folder where you will find Jsoup

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
